* As a visual artist that uses astronomical images for inspiration, I want to be able to browse (in a non-linear fashion) a library of such images, so that they can be viewed and downloaded for processing/incorporation/etc.

* As a science teacher that relies on visual presentations in the classroom, I need to be able to browse and download (for display or printing) high-quality, interesting astronomical images to share with my students, to increase the appeal of astronomy curriculum to students.

* As an easily-bored computer user, I want a source for a large quantity of high-resolution images, that I can use as desktop wallpaper on my computer.
